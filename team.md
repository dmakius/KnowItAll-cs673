# Your team introduction 
 Each student should add a separate paragraph to introduce yourself. 

Hello,

My name is Daniel Makover and I am a graduate student in Computer Science. During the job I am an IT Specialist in Supply Chain Logistics and at night I like to develope web applications and video games. I also enjoy hiking and painting with acrylics. Fun fact, I am getting married this semester. 

My name is Gunnar Nichols. I work as a cost estimator and am pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science with a specialization in data analytics. In my free time I like to study math and improve myself.
