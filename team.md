Hi! My name is **Weiye Xu**. I am a master student of computer science at Boston University. I don't have much work experience with programming, because I just graduated from an undergraduate university. Since the Covid-19, most of time I will not go to a place where there are too many people, or just stay at home use my free time to keep studying and improve myself. During the meeting, you may find that I don't talk much sometimes. In fact, I'm not very good at expressing my ideas verbally, but I will try. I'm very excited that we can work together to make a good project.

Hi! My name is Yuwei WU. I am a 2nd year master student in CS program, with a concentration in Data Analytics. I used to study literature, anthropology and arts administrations. I used to work as a market researcher and once interned at a non-profit art org in Boston. After all these experiences, I decided to learn computer science to have different perspective for my career path.
